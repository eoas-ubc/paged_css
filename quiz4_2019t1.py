#      **oxygen** at one location in the **NORTHERN** Hemisphere over the
#      time period of one year. During which seasons do points “A”
#      and “B” most likely occur? Choose the **BEST** answer. *Again, note,
#      this is atmospheric **oxygen.**
#
#    (A) “A” is in the spring, “B” is in the fall  
#    (B) “A” is in the fall, “B” is in the spring  
#    (C) “A” is in the winter, “B” is in the summer  
#    (D) “A” is in the summer, “B” is in the winter  
#    (E) There is not enough information to determine season.

# Q1 Answer: A -- O$_2$ will be accumulating throughout the summmer months due to photosynthesis, reaching a peak when photosynthesis rates reduce and are balanced by respiration rates. This occurs in the fall.

# Q2) The figure at right shows how $δ^{13}C$ changes with water
#     depth in the ocean, with “heavier” values in the surface water and
#     “lighter” values in the deeper water. Shells made by organisms
#     living at different water depths follow this pattern. What is the
#     dominant reason these data show this pattern?
#
#    (A)  Marine plants near the surface prefer to use $^{12}C$ in
#         photosynthesis, while marine plants in the deep ocean prefer to
#         use $^{13}C$ for photosynthesis.
#
#    (B)  The solubility pump preferentially takes $^{12}C$ from the
#         surface to the deep ocean when water sinks at locations where
#         deep water forms (like in the North Atlantic Ocean near
#         Greenland).
#
#    (C)  $^{13}C$ is heavier than $^{12}C$ and the heavier
#         isotope sinks from the surface ocean to the deep ocean.
#
#    (D)  $^{12}C$ evaporates more easily than $^{13}C$, so
#         the heavier isotope is left behind in the surface ocean by
#         evaporation of the lighter isotope.
#
#    (E)  The biological pump transfers relatively more $^{12}C$
#         from the surface to the deep ocean, leaving behind the heavier
#         $^{13}C$ isotope.
#
# %% [markdown] {"trusted": true, "ctype": "answer", "qnum": 2, "key": "E"}
# Q2 Answer: E -- photosynthetic organisms use up $^{12}C$, which settles downwards in the water column as organisms excrete waste or die.

# Q3) Carbon cycle global annual fluxes to or from the modern atmosphere
#     are listed in alphabetical order: human emissions (fossil fuels,
#     cement, and land-use change), photosynthesis, volcanic emissions.
#     Rank each *source or sink* from largest to smallest **magnitude**.  
#       
#    (A) human emissions, photosynthesis, volcanic emissions  
#    (B) photosynthesis, human emissions, volcanic emissions  
#    (C) volcanic emissions, photosynthesis, human emissions  
#    (D) human emissions, volcanic emissions, photosynthesis  
#    (E) photosynthesis, volcanic emissions, human emissions  
#
# %% [markdown] {"ctype": "answer", "qnum": 3, "key": "B"}
# Q3 Answer: B -- Photosynthesis is a sink, but has the largest magnitude (about 120 GtC/year) and is balanced by respiration/decay. Human emissions are smaller (about 9 GtC/year), but provide a steady imbalance to the flux into the atmosphere. Volcanoes are a much slower, longer term source, at about 0.1-0.2 GtC/year.

# Q4) Based on your knowledge of physical-chemistry, which conditions 
#     do you believe would lead to a lower pH in the oceans?
#
#    (A) decreasing $CO_2$, increasing atmospheric pressure,
#     increasing temperature
#
#    (B) increasing $CO_2$, increasing atmospheric pressure,
#     increasing temperature
#
#    (C) increasing $CO_2$, increasing atmospheric pressure,
#     decreasing temperature
#
#    (D) increasing $CO_2$, decreasing atmospheric pressure,
#     decreasing temperature
#
#    (E) decreasing $CO_2$, decreasing atmospheric pressure,
#     increasing temperature
#
# %% [markdown] {"trusted": true, "ctype": "answer", "qnum": 4, "key": "C"}
# Q4 Answer: C -- Solubility of CO$_2$ increases with decreasing temperature and increasing CO$_2$ partial pressure. Partial pressure can be increased by increasing either total atmospheric pressure or atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration.

# Q5) During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) event, the
#     $δ^{13}$C values for carbon in the ocean got lighter by about
#     3 units, as shown in the figure. There is still debate about the
#     origin of the carbon that caused this shift. Of the choices, which
#     one would require the **fewest** gigatons of carbon to get a -3‰
#     shift in $δ^{13}$C?
#
#
#    (A) Methane with a $δ^{13}$C value of -60  
#    (B) Methane with a $δ^{13}$C value of -35  
#    (C) Organic carbon with a $δ^{13}$C value of -22  
#    (D) Fossil fuels with a $δ^{13}$C value of -22

# Q6) Which of the following is **most likely** true regarding the 
#     relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO$_2$ during 
#     the last major deglaciation?
#
#    (A) CO$_2$ concentration **did not affect** temperatures 
#     because it acted as a **feedback** rather than a forcing.  
#    (B) CO$_2$ concentration **rose prior to** the initial 
#     temperature rise, and amplified the observed temperature 
#     changes because it acted as a **feedback**.  
#    (C) CO$_2$ concentration **rose prior to** the initial 
#     temperature rise, and amplified the observed temperature 
#     changes because it acted as a **forcing**.  
#    (D) CO$_2$ concentration **rose after** the initial 
#     temperature rise, and amplified the observed temperature
#     changes because it acted as a **feedback**.  
#    (E) CO$_2$ concentration **rose after** the initial

# Q6 Answer: D -- CO$_2$ lagged behind initial temperature rise, but likely amplified temperature changes due to the ocean solubility feedback.

# Q7) Imagine we burn 2000 gigatonnes of carbon in the coming years.  By how much will the 
#  atmospheric concentration of CO2 increase?  Assume we burn everything instantaneously, 
#  that 45% of the emitted carbon stays in the atmosphere, and that today’s atmospheric 
#  CO2 concentration is 410 ppm.  Choose the closest answer.

# Q8) Below is a figure from the class slides showing the increase in
#     solar luminosity over time. Considering this change in
#     incoming solar radiation as a forcing, and considering the long-term
#     feedback that involves chemical weathering, temperature, and
#     atmospheric $CO_2$, why might global temperatures today be about the
#     same as 2 billion years ago, despite greater solar intensity today?
#     *Think long-term processes here.*  
#  
#     
#    (A) Atmospheric $CO_2$ two billion years ago was most likely 
#       **higher** than today, because **chemical weathering was**
#       **stronger** when the Sun was 
#    (B) Atmospheric $CO_2$ two billion years ago was most likely 
#       **higher** than today, because **chemical weathering was**
#       **weaker** when the Sun was more dim. 
#    (C) Atmospheric $CO_2$ two billion years ago was most likely 
#       **lower** than today, because **chemical weathering was**
#       **stronger** when the Sun was more dim.
#    (D) Atmospheric $CO_2$ two billion years ago was most likely 
#       **lower** than today, because **chemical weathering was**
#       **weaker** when the Sun was more dim.
#    (E) Atmospheric $CO_2$ two billion years ago was most likely 
#       **the same as** today, because **chemical weathering feedback**
#       **maintained concentrations** when the Sun was more dim.
